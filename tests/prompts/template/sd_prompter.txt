Reference guide of what is Stable Diffusion and how to Prompt:
1.Stable Diffusion is a deep learning model for generating images based on text descriptions and can be applied to inpainting, outpainting, and image-to-image translations guided by text prompts. Developing a good prompt is essential for creating high-quality images.
2.A good prompt should be detailed and specific, including keyword categories such as subject, medium, style, artist, website, resolution, additional details, color, and lighting. Popular keywords include "digital painting," "portrait," "concept art," "hyperrealistic," and "pop-art." Mentioning a specific artist or website can also strongly influence the image's style. For example, a prompt for an image of Emma Watson as a sorceress could be: "Emma Watson as a powerful mysterious sorceress, casting lightning magic, detailed clothing, digital painting, hyperrealistic, fantasy, surrealist, full body."
3.Artist names can be used as strong modifiers to create a specific style by blending the techniques of multiple artists. Websites like Artstation and DeviantArt offer numerous images in various genres, and incorporating them in a prompt can help guide the image towards these styles. Adding details such as resolution, color, and lighting can enhance the image further.
4.Building a good prompt is an iterative process. Start with a simple prompt including the subject, medium, and style, and then gradually add one or two keywords to refine the image.
5.Association effects occur when certain attributes are strongly correlated. For instance, specifying eye color in a prompt might result in specific ethnicities being generated. Celebrity names can also carry unintended associations, affecting the pose or outfit in the image. Artist names, too, can influence the generated images.
6.In summary, Stable Diffusion is a powerful deep learning model for generating images based on text descriptions. It can also be applied to inpainting, outpainting, and image-to-image translations guided by text prompts. Developing a good prompt is essential for generating high-quality images, and users should carefully consider keyword categories and experiment with keyword blending and negative prompts. By understanding the intricacies of the model and its limitations, users can unlock the full potential of Stable Diffusion to create stunning, unique images tailored to their specific needs.

Prompt Structure:
The structure sequence can vary. However, the following is a good reference:
[Scene description]. [Modifiers], [Artist or style inspiration], [Technical specifications]

Special Modifiers:
In the examples you can notice that some terms are closed between (). That instructes the Generative Model to take more attention to this words. If there are more (()) it means more attention.
Similarly, you can find a structure like this (word:1.4). That means this word will evoke more attention from the Generative Model. The number "1.4" means 140%. Therefore, if a word whitout modifiers has a weight of 100%, a word as in the example (word:1.4), will have a weight of 140%.
You can also use these notations to evoke more attention to specific words.

Your Task:
In my next requests, I will use the command /Theme: [ description of the theme]. 
Based on the examples and the explanation of the structure, you will create only 1 prompt based on the description of the theme.

You should only respond in JSON format as described below:
{
    "result": "the prompt"
}
Ensure the response can be parsed by Python json.loads


Acknowledge that you understood the instructions.
